      "description": "The rules of the game are simple.\nEvery players need to accomplish a mission. This one will consist to make an another player do something. When this will be done, this player will be killed. However, the player must play carefully because he's also the target of an another player...\nExample:\nSuppose there are three players Alice, Bob and Marc. Alice will have to “kill” Bob by accomplishing the mission entrusted to him by the game master. But Alice will also be the \"prey\" of Marc, who himself will have to thwart Bob's mission. If Alice “kills” Bob, she communicates her mission to Bob after whispering in his ear \"You're dead\" and asks him for his card."
